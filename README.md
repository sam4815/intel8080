## About

This is the second in a series of emulators I've worked on, with the eventual goal of writing a GBA emulator. In comparison to the preceding [CHIP-8 emulator](https://github.com/sam4815/chip8), the [Intel 8080 processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080) is a much more complicated machine. Its instruction set is almost ten times the size of the CHIP-8's, and it requires the implementation of tricky concepts like [hardware interrupts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt).

Many video arcade games were built around the 8080 microprocessor, including Space Invaders, one of the most popular arcade games ever made. I've also sourced two lesser-known arcade games, Balloon Bomber and Lunar Rescue, both of which appear to work well on this emulator.
